# Student Adaptive Learning Engine

This project provides a system for adaptive learning where student interactions are tracked and dynamically adjusted based on their learning progress. The engine uses FastAPI to create and manage student sessions, while Azure OpenAI services provide natural language processing capabilities such as rephrasing queries, answering questions, validating responses, and generating recommendations.

## Requirements

To install the environment and required dependencies for the project, use the following command:

```bash
python -m venv student_chatbot_env
.\student_chatbot_env\Scripts\activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## API Overview

### 1. **POST /sessions**

#### **Purpose**:
Creates a new learning session for a student, including their learning goals, level, and difficulty settings.

#### **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "123",
  "student_level": "beginner",
  "learning_goals": ["Improve English", "Practice Grammar"]
}
```

- **student_id**: A unique identifier for the student.
- **student_level**: The level of the student, which can be `"beginner"`, `"intermediate"`, or `"advanced"`.
- **learning_goals**: A list of goals the student aims to achieve during the session.

#### **Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Session created successfully.",
  "session_id": "abcdef123456"
}
```

- **message**: A confirmation message indicating whether the session creation was successful.
- **session_id**: A unique session identifier for tracking the student's progress.

#### **Usage**:
This endpoint is used to start a learning session for a student. The system creates a new session with the provided learning goals, student level, and difficulty level based on the student's level.

### 2. **POST /sessions/{student_id}/{session_id}/interactions**

#### **Purpose**:
Tracks an interaction between the student and the system, allowing the student to ask a question and receive an answer. The query is rephrased, processed, and validated, and the interaction is scored for difficulty adaptation.

#### **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "query": "What is the past tense of run?"
}
```

- **query**: The student's question or query.

#### **Response**:
```json
{
  "interaction_id": "interaction123456",
  "answer": "The past tense of 'run' is 'ran'."
}
```

- **interaction_id**: A unique identifier for this interaction.
- **answer**: The answer generated by the system based on the student's query.

#### **Usage**:
This endpoint allows the student to interact with the system by asking a question. The system rephrases the query, generates an answer, and adapts the session difficulty based on the interaction score. This helps the system personalize the experience according to the student's learning pace.

### 3. **GET /sessions/{student_id}/{session_id}**

#### **Purpose**:
Fetches the current state of a specific learning session, including progress, difficulty level, and session details.

#### **Response**:
```json
{
  "session_state": "in progress",
  "session_progress": 50,
  "number_of_interactions": 5,
  "difficulty_level": "medium",
  "student_level": "beginner",
  "avg_student_rating": 4.2,
  "avg_response_time": 2.3,
  "learning_goals": ["Improve English"]
}
```

- **session_state**: The current state of the session (e.g., "in progress").
- **session_progress**: The progress made in the session (e.g., 50%).
- **number_of_interactions**: The number of interactions that have occurred.
- **difficulty_level**: The current difficulty level for the session.
- **student_level**: The student’s level (e.g., "beginner").
- **avg_student_rating**: The average rating of the student’s performance.
- **avg_response_time**: The average time it took to respond to the student’s queries.
- **learning_goals**: The list of goals the student is working toward.

#### **Usage**:
This endpoint is used to get an overview of the student's learning session, allowing the student or an administrator to view how the session is progressing. It provides a snapshot of the session's state, interaction history, and performance metrics.

### 4. **GET /sessions/{student_id}/{session_id}/recommendations**

#### **Purpose**:
Generates learning recommendations for the student based on their progress, session history, and learning goals. This feature helps guide the student to the next best steps in their learning journey.

#### **Response**:
```json
{
  "recommended_questions": ["What are some tips for improving English vocabulary?", "How can I improve my writing skills?"]
}
```

- **recommended_questions**: A list of suggested learning questions or resources to continue the student's education.

#### **Usage**:
This endpoint provides dynamic learning recommendations to the student based on their session history and progress. It helps personalize the learning experience by suggesting relevant topics or questions to improve the student's knowledge in areas they are working on.

## Workflow

1. **Create a Session**:
   - When a student logs in or starts their learning journey, a session is created using the `/sessions` endpoint. The session includes basic information such as the student's learning goals and their current level.
   
2. **Track Interactions**:
   - During the session, the student can ask questions, and these interactions are tracked using the `/sessions/{student_id}/{session_id}/interactions` endpoint. Each interaction is processed, the query is rephrased for clarity, an answer is generated, and the difficulty level is adjusted based on the student's performance.

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - At any time, the session state, progress, and performance metrics can be retrieved using the `/sessions/{student_id}/{session_id}` endpoint. This helps monitor how well the student is progressing in their learning journey.

4. **Receive Recommendations**:
   - The system can suggest additional resources or questions for the student to explore based on their learning history and progress using the `/sessions/{student_id}/{session_id}/recommendations` endpoint.

## Conclusion

The **Student Adaptive Learning Engine** is a powerful tool designed to enhance the learning experience through dynamic, personalized sessions. By leveraging Azure OpenAI services, it provides the ability to adapt learning materials, rephrase student queries, answer questions, and offer relevant learning recommendations. This system is ideal for creating a personalized, interactive, and adaptive learning environment for students at various skill levels.
